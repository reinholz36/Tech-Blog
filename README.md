# Tech-Blog

## Overview:

I built the front and back end of a tech blog website using Model-View-Controller (MVC) structure. The application uses Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication. Users can view, create, edit, upvote, and delete blog posts. 

## Technologies Used:
